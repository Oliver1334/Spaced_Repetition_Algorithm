# Spaced Repetition Vocabulary Learning Game

This Spaced Repetition Vocabulary Game is a terminal-based educational tool designed to help users learn and retain new vocabulary using a spaced repetition algorithm. Words are reviewed in increasing intervals, reinforcing understanding over time for better memorisation. If a user answers incorrectly the game ends and the user is given a high score before the option to retry from the beginning, encouraging consistent practice.


## Features

  * Spaced Repetition Algorithm: A spaced repetition list is created and written to a CSV file so that words can be reviewed at progressive intervals.
  * Word Definitions: Definitions are sourced from a JSON dictionary file.
  * Game Mode: Users are prompted to define words in order of the spaced repetition sequence, with instant feedback.
